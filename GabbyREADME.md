### ~ Responsive Design ~

Responsive design focuses on creating websites that can adapt to various screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, laptops, and phones. 
The goal is to provide the best possible user experience regardless of the user's device, screen size, or orientation.
Responsive design involves using flexible layouts, images, and media queries to ensure that the website content is displayed in the most appropriate way for each device. This means that the website will look and function correctly, with readable content and intuitive navigation, no matter how it is accessed. 
Responsive design is essential for our Codebloggs app development. Many people these days are constantly on their cellphone. 
By implementing responsive design through CSS and media queries, we can create a blog page that is accessible and user-friendly for everyone, regardless of their device. Access to more customers/users would make any company happy!  
This means that Codebloggs will hopefully refer us to other companies to design sites for them as well. Using responsive design is a win-win-win! 
	
### ~ Reactive Design ~  
  
Reactive design is a web development approach that focuses on creating websites that are highly responsive to user interactions. 
Itâ€™s all about creating web applications that can react to a users input in real time. This means that users can interact with the website more efficiently, without having to wait for the page to load every time they perform an action. 
It is useful for web applications such as social networks, chat applications, and online games. 
Reactive design is becoming increasingly popular in web development as more developers recognize the benefits of creating responsive websites.
Using reactive design in our CodeBloggs app will improve the posting, liking, and commenting features. 
By implementing reactive design principles like skeleton loaders into our CodeBloggs project, we can create a blog that is more intuitive, more engaging, and most importantly, faster for all users. 
Humans are becoming more impatient these days due to the fact that they can get anything they want within a blink of an eye. 
This means that the speed of our Codebloggs app is imperative! The faster our page loads, the more people will be engaged with our app and want to continuously use it. 

### ~ Explain the Differnece ~

Reactive and responsive design both focus on creating websites and web applications that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, 
however, they differ in the fact that they serve different purposes. 
While responsive design primarily focuses on adapting the layout and content to fit different screen sizes, 
reactive design is more focused on creating a highly interactive user experience that responds in real time to user actions.
